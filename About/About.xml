	<targetVersion>0.18.0</targetVersion>
	<description>&lt;color=red&gt;Requires HugsLib. Incompatible with other Work Tab mods.&lt;/color&gt;

Replaces the Work tab with an overhauled version incorporating a drag-and-drop interface:

• Enable/disable work with ctrl-click.

• Prioritise work by dragging and dropping.

• Mass-prioritise by shift-clicking a work type from the top row.

• Mass-enable/disable by ctrl-clicking on a work type from the top row.

• Work Functions button: enable/disable/reset work, copy and paste priorities.

• Colour-coded interface allows you to estimate colonist skill at a glance.

• Compare Skills window lets you sort colonists by skill for more convenient comparison.

• Familiar tooltips for nearly everything in the interface including descriptions, skill level, disability warning etc.

• Mod options for extra user experience adjustments (Options -> Mod Settings).</description>
