# DD Work Tab
Replaces RimWorld's number-based Work tab with a drag-and-drop system.

## Simple to pick up and use
* Priorities are easy to set up and visualize (after a brief adjustment period).
* Disable or reset all work for any given colonist with a simple button press.
* Prioritizing a single work type is easy. No more adjusting every other type to make a colonist focus on what you want!
* Disable work by dragging it off of the colonist's row.
* Re-order priorities by dragging within the row, or drop from the main categories list to the desired location.
